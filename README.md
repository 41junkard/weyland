A Foundry VTT theming module for [AlienRPG system](https://github.com/pwatson100/alienrpg)

This module is inspired by [AlienCRT UI module](https://github.com/FranzWarm/AlienCRT_UI) by FranzWarm.

The main goal of this module is to provide a complete Foundry VTT UI theming, and not only AlienRPG system sheets like AlienCRT UI does.
So these two modules are complementary and should be used together.

Scaffolded with [NickEast's Foundry Project Creator](https://gitlab.com/foundry-projects/foundry-pc/create-foundry-project)
